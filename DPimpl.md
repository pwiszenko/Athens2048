# Design pattern implementation <a id="DP"></a>

We chose Singleton and Strategy patterns. We didn't use decoration pattern, because it would have no use for our game. Some of the possible new featires of 2048 could be:
- possibility to change grid's size
- possibility to play after achieving '2048' tile

In a game where for example we have a spaceship on which we can upgrade it's weapons, we could treat them as decorations:
`gun - shoot()` `laser - shoot()` `rocket - shoot()`

## Singleton

Singleton pattern was used in `RandomPicker` class. The class takes care of randomly picking an empty tile in the game. In this case we don't need/want several instances of the same class.

## Strategy

Strategy pattern was used for GUI design: the player can choose two colour themes. Applying strategy pattern allows adding extra  themes on the runtime.
